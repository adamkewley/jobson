Jobson is a platform (backend webserver, frontend UI, and command-line
client) that transforms command-line applications into a web-ready job
service. Jobson's goal is to make it easy to share existing
applications across the web without requiring a lot of server
expertise. It was started in 2017 as internal software for handling
scientific data requests for the [Gaia](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia)
satellite mission. Because it solves a general problem (turning
arbitrary CLI applications into a web service) it was subsequently
open-sourced in 2018.

Jobson generates a standard web service from a job specification file:

```yaml
name: Trivial Application
description: Echoes supplied message to stdout

expectedInputs:
- id: message
  type: string
  name: Message
  description: The message to echo
  default: Hello, world!

execution:
  application: echo
  arguments:
  - ${inputs.message}
```
